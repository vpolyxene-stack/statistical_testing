# statistical_testing
This project applies statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether
high-spending customers are significantly more likely to respond to a marketing campaign
than low-spending customers.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- statsmodels

## Key Insights
- High-spending customers respond at a significantly higher rate than low-spending customers.
- A two-proportion z-test confirms that this difference is highly statistically significant (p < 0.001).
- Spending-based segmentation can be used to support evidence-driven campaign targeting decisions.
